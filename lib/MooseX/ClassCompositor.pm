=head1 NAME

MooseX::ClassCompositor - a factory that builds classes from roles

=head1 VERSION

version 0.003

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $comp = MooseX::ClassCompositor->new({
    class_basename  => 'MyApp::Class',
    class_metaroles => {
      class => [ 'MooseX::StrictConstructor::Trait::Class' ],
    },
    role_prefixes   => {
      ''  => 'MyApp::Role::',
      '=' => '',
    },
  });

  my $class = $comp->class_for( qw( PieEater ContestWinner ) );

  my $object = $class->new({
    pie_type => 'banana',
    place    => '2nd',
  });

=head1 OVERVIEW

A MooseX::ClassCompositor is a class factory.  If you think using a class
factory will make you feel like a filthy "enterprise" programmer, maybe you
should turn back now.

The compositor has a C<L</class_for>> method that builds a class by combining a
list of roles with L<Moose::Object>, applying any supplied metaclass, and
producing an arbitrary-but-human-scannable name.  The metaclass is then
made immutable, the operation is memoized, and the class name is returned.

In the L</SYNOPSIS> above, you can see all the major features used:
C<class_metaroles> to enable strict constructors, C<role_prefixes> to use
L<String::RewritePrefix> to expand role name shorthand, and C<class_basename>
to pick a namespace under which to put constructed classes.

Not shown is the C<L</known_classes>> method, which returns a list of pairs
describing all the classes that the factory has constructed.  This method can
be useful for debugging and other somewhat esoteric purposes like
serialization.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 class_basename

This attribute must be given, and must be a valid Perl package name.
Constructed classes will all be under this namespace.

=head2 class_metaroles

This attribute, if given, must be a hashref of class metaroles that will be
applied to newly-constructed classes with
L<Moose::Util::MetaRole::apply_metaroles>.

=head2 known_classes

This attribute stores a mapping of class names to the parameters used to
construct them.  The C<known_classes> method returns its contents as a list of
pairs.

=head2 role_prefixes

This attribute is used as the arguments to L<String::RewritePrefix> for
expanding role names passed to the compositor's L<class_for> method.

=head2 fixed_roles

This attribute may be initialized with an arrayref of role names.  These roles
will I<always> be composed in the classes built by the compositor.

These names I<will> be rewritten by the role prefixes.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 class_for

  my $class = $compositor->class_for(

    'Role::Name', # <-- will be expanded with role_prefixes

    [
      'Param::Role::Name', #  <-- will be expanded with role_prefixes
      'ApplicationName',   #  <-- will not be touched
      { ...param... },
    ],
  );

This method will return a class with the roles passed to it.  They can be given
either as names (which will be expanded according to C<L</role_prefixes>>) or
as arrayrefs containing a role name, application name, and hashref of
parameters.  In the arrayref form, the application name is just a name used to
uniquely identify this application of a parameterized role, so that they can be
applied multiple times with each application accounted for internally.

Note that at present, passing Moose::Meta::Role objects is B<not> supported.
This should change in the future.
